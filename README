Legend / MRQII Character sheet helper
( http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/rpgs/legend/legend.html ) 

For the purpose of some of my players I've made a simple page to optimize the
Skill calculation duty.
We are French so this sheet is. If any want to localise it feel free !

It's just HTML and JS.

Features :

 * Edit your character with some automatic calculations
 * Save/load it with your browser LocalStorage feature (only one sheet)
 * Export it in 2 SVG files
