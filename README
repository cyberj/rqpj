Legend / MRQII Character sheet helper
( http://www.mongoosepublishing.com/rpgs/legend/legend.html ) 

WORK IN PROGRESS (I suppose?)

For some of my players I've made a simple page to optimize the Skill
calculation duty. This can be an excuse for this poor commented code.
We are French so this sheet is. If any want to localise it feel free !

It's just HTML and JS (AngularJS).

Features :

 * Edit your character with some automatic calculations
 * Save/load it with your browser LocalStorage feature (only one sheet)
 * Export it in 2 SVG files

Oh : and yeah my CSS skills are terrible.
